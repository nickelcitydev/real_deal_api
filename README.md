# RealDealApi

This is a simple REST API built by following the [Elixir API: Password Authentication](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2Rv8vpZJz4zM3Go3X-dda478p-6xrmEl) YouTube tutorial series by [Elixir Mentor](https://www.youtube.com/@elixirmentor).

There are some slight changes from what is shown in the YouTube videos as this was built with a more recent version of Phoenix (v1.7.11).

  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
